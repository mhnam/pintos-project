# Pintos Project

## Overview
Pintos project had been done as a part of OS class in 2020 fall semester. This project had been implemented in several sub-projects as follows:

### Project #0.2: Interactive Shell
Made a interactive shell program which tests commands used in pintos project.

SEE https://github.com/mhnam/pintosOS/tree/main/proj0-2

### Project #1: System Call Handler
Implemented ``system call handler`` by modifying ``process.c`` and ``syscall.c`` in ``/src/userprog/`` directory, which is a part of project 2 in pintos mannual.

SEE https://github.com/mhnam/pintosOS/blob/main/syscall.md

### Project #2: Filesystem
Implemented ``filesystem`` adding ``additional system calls``, which is leftover from project 2 in pintos mannual.

SEE https://github.com/mhnam/pintosOS/blob/main/filesys.md

### Project #3: Threads
Implemented ``alarm clock`` and ``priority scheduling`` with ``advanced scheduler`` by modifying files mostly in ``src/threads``, which is a project 1 in pintos mannual.

SEE https://github.com/mhnam/pintosOS/blob/main/threads.md

### Project #4: Virtual Memory
Will implement ``virtual memory``, which is a project 3 in pintos mannual
